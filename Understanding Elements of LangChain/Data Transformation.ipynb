Whenever we talk about the \\n‘memory’ of a computer system, we usually talk about the \\nmain or primary memory. The secondary memory (also \\ncalled storage device) is used to store data, instructions \\nand results permanently for future use.\\n1.3.1 Units of Memory\\nA computer system uses binary numbers to store and \\nprocess data. The binary digits 0 and 1, which are the \\nbasic units of memory, are called bits. Further, these \\nbits are grouped together to form words. A 4-bit word \\nis called a Nibble. Examples of nibble are 1001, 1010, \\n0010, etc. A two nibble word, i.e., 8-bit word is called a \\nbyte, for example, 01000110, 01111100, 10000001, etc.\\nLike any other standard unit, bytes are grouped \\ntogether to make bigger chunks or units of memory. \\nTable 1.1 shows different measurement units for digital \\ndata stored in storage devices.\\nCh 1.indd   5 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n6\\n1.3.2 Types of Memory\\nHuman beings memorise many things over a lifetime, and \\nrecall from memory to make a decision or some action.\\nHowever, we do not rely on our memory completely, and \\nwe make notes and store important data and information \\nusing other media, such as notebook, manual, journal, \\ndocument, etc. Similarly, computers have two types of \\nmemory   — primary and secondary. \\n(A) Primary Memory\\nPrimary memory is an essential component of \\na \\ncomputer system. Program and data are loaded into the \\nprimary memory before processing. The CPU interacts \\ndirectly with the primary memory to perform read or \\nwrite operation. It is of two types viz. (i) Random Access \\nMemory (RAM) and (ii) Read Only Memory (ROM).\\nRAM is volatile, i.e., as long as the power is supplied \\nto the computer, it retains the data in it. But as soon \\nas the power supply is turned off, all the contents of \\nRAM are wiped out. It is used to store data temporarily \\nwhile the computer is working. Whenever the computer \\nis started or a software application is launched, the \\nrequired program and data are loaded into RAM \\nfor processing. RAM is usually referred to as main \\nmemory and it is faster than the secondary memory or \\nstorage devices.\\nOn the other hand, ROM is non-volatile, which \\nmeans its contents are not lost even when the power is \\nturned off. It is used as a small but faster permanent \\nstorage for the contents which are rarely changed. For \\nexample, the startup program (boot loader) that loads \\nthe operating system into primary memory, is stored  \\nin ROM.\\n(B) Cache Memory\\nRAM is faster than secondary storage, but not as \\nfast \\nas a computer processor. So, because of RAM, a CPU \\nTable 1.1 Measurement units for digital data\\nUnit Description Unit Description\\nKB (Kilobyte) 1 KB = 1024 Bytes PB (Petabyte) 1 PB = 1024 TB\\nMB (Megabyte) 1 MB = 1024 KB EB (Exabyte) 1 EB = 1024 PB\\nGB (Gigabyte) 1 GB = 1024 MB ZB (Zettabyte) 1 ZB = 1024 EB\\nTB (Terabyte) 1 TB = 1024 GB YB (Yottabyte) 1 YB = 1024 ZB\\nSuppose there is a \\ncomputer with RAM \\nbut no secondary \\nstorage. Can we install \\na software on that \\ncomputer?\\nThink and Reflect\\nCh 1.indd   6 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n7\\nmay have to slow down. To speed up the operations of \\nthe CPU, a very high speed memory is placed between \\nthe CPU and the primary memory known as cache. It \\nstores the copies of the data from frequently accessed \\nprimary memory locations, thus, reducing the average \\ntime required to access data from primary memory. \\nWhen the CPU needs some data, it first examines the \\ncache. In case the requirement is met, it is read from \\nthe cache, otherwise the primary memory is accessed.\\n(C) Secondary Memory\\nPrimary memory has limited storage \\ncapacity and \\nis either volatile (RAM) or read-only (ROM). Thus, a \\ncomputer system needs auxiliary or secondary memory \\nto permanently store the data or instructions for \\nfuture use. The secondary memory is non-volatile and \\nhas larger storage capacity than primary memory. It \\nis slower and cheaper than the main memory. But, it \\ncannot be accessed directly by the CPU. Contents of \\nsecondary storage need to be first brought into the main \\nmemory for the CPU to access. Examples of secondary \\nmemory devices include Hard Disk Drive (HDD), CD/\\nDVD, Memory Card, etc., as shown in Figure 1.7.\\nHowever, these days, there are secondary storage \\ndevices like SSD which support very fast data transfer \\nspeed as compared to earlier HDDs. Also, data transfer \\nbetween computers have become easier and simple due \\nto the availability of small-sized and portable flash or \\npen drives. \\n1.4 data tranSfer between memory and cpu\\nData need to be transferred between the CPU and \\nprimary memory as well as between the primary and \\nsecondary memory. \\nData are transferred between different components of \\na computer system using physical wires called bus. For \\nexample, bus is used for data transfer between a USB \\nport and hard disk or between a hard disk and main \\nmemory. Bus is of three types — (i) Data bus to transfer \\ndata between different components, (ii) Address bus to \\ntransfer addresses between CPU and main memory. \\nThe address of the memory location that the CPU wants \\nto \\nread or write from is specified in the address bus, \\nFigure 1.7: Storage devices \\nPen \\nDrive\\nCD/DVD\\nCh 1.indd   7 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\"Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n8\\nand (iii) Control bus to communicate  \\ncontrol signals between different \\ncomponents of a computer. All these \\nthree buses collectively make the \\nsystem bus, as shown in Figure 1.8.\\nAs the CPU interacts directly with \\nmain memory, any data entered from \\ninput device or the data to be accessed \\nfrom hard disk needs to be placed in the \\nmain memory for further processing. \\nThe data is then transferred between \\nCPU and main memory using bus.\\nThe CPU places on the address bus, the address of \\nthe main memory location from which it wants to read \\ndata or to write data. While executing the instructions, \\nthe CPU specifies the read or write control signal through \\nthe control bus. \\nAs the CPU may require to read data from main \\nmemory or write data to main memory, a data bus is \\nbidirectional. But the control bus and address bus are \\nunidirectional. To write data into memory, the CPU \\nplaces the data on the data bus, which is then written \\nto the specific address provided through the address \\nbus. In case of read operation, the CPU specifies the \\naddress, and the data is placed on the data bus by a \\ndedicated hardware, called memory controller. The \\nmemory controller manages the flow of data into and \\nout of the computer's main memory.\\n1.5 mIcroproceSSorS\\nIn earlier days, a computer's CPU used to occupy a large \\nroom or  multiple cabinets. However, with advancement \\nin technology, the physical size of CPU has reduced and \\nit is now possible to place a CPU on a single microchip \\nonly. A processor (CPU) which is implemented on a \\nsingle microchip is called microprocessor. Nowadays, \\nalmost all the CPUs are microprocessors. Hence, the \\nterms are used synonymously for practical purpose.\\nMicroprocessor  is a small-sized electronic component \\ninside a computer that carries out various tasks involved \\nin data processing as well as arithmetic and logical \\noperations. These days, a microprocessor is built over \\nan integrated circuit comprising millions of small \\ncomponents like resistors, transistors and diodes.\\n Figure 1.8: Data transfer between components through \\nsystem bus\\nCh 1.indd   8 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n9\\nMicroprocessors have evolved over time in terms \\nof their increased processing capability, decreasing \\nphysical size and reduced cost.

Clock speed simply \\nmeans the number of pulses generated per second by the \\nCh 1.indd   9 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n10\\nclock inside a computer. The clock speed indicates the \\nspeed at which the computer can execute instructions.\\nEarlier, it was measured in Hertz (Hz) and Kilohertz \\n(kHz). But with advancement in technology and chip \\ndensity, it is now measured in Gigahertz (GHz), i.e., \\nbillions of pulses per second.\\n(D) Cores\\nCore is a basic computation unit of the CPU. Earlier \\nprocessors had only one computation unit, thereby \\ncapable of performing only  one task at a time. With the \\nadvent of multicore processor, it has become possible \\nfor the computer to \\nexecute multiple tasks, thereby \\nincreasing the system’s performance. CPU with two, \\nfour, and eight cores is called dual-core, quad-core and \\nocta-core processor, respectively. \\n1.5.2 Microcontrollers\\nThe microcontroller is a small computing device which \\nhas a CPU, a fixed amount of RAM, ROM and other \\nperipherals all embedded on a single chip as compared \\nto microprocessor that has only a CPU on the chip. The \\nstructure of a microcontroller is shown in Figure 1.9. \\nKeyboard, mouse, washing machine, digital camera, \\npendrive, remote controller, microwave are few examples \\nof microcontrollers. As these are designed for specific \\ntasks only, hence their size as well as cost is reduced. \\nBecause of the very small size of the \\nmicrocontroller, it is embedded in another device \\nor system to perform a specific functionality. For \\nexample, the microcontroller in a fully automatic \\nwashing machine is used to control the washing cycle \\nwithout any human intervention. The cycle starts \\nwith the filling of water, after which the clothes are \\nsoaked and washed; thereafter the water is drained \\nand the clothes are spin dry. The simple use of \\nmicrocontroller has permitted repetitive execution \\nof tedious tasks automatically without any human \\nintervention, thereby saving precious time.\\n1.6 data and InformatIon\\nA computer is primarily for processing data. A computer \\nsystem considers everything as data, be it instructions, \\npictures, songs, videos, documents, etc. Data can also be \\nFigure 1.9: Structure of \\nmicrocontroller\\nClock CPU Memory\\nBus System\\nInput Output\\nI/O-ports\\nActivity 1.2\\nFind out the clock speed \\nof the microprocessor \\nof your computer and \\ncompare with that of \\nyour peers?\\nCh 1.indd   10 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n11\\nraw and unorganised facts that are processed to get \\nmeaningful information.\\nSo understanding the concept of data along with \\nits different types is crucial to understand the overall \\nfunctioning of a computer. Sometimes people use the \\nterms data, information and knowledge interchangeably, \\nwhich is incorrect. \\n1.6.1 Data and Its Types\\nA computer system has many input devices, which \\nprovide it with raw data in the form of facts, concepts, \\ninstructions, etc., Internally everything is stored in \\nbinary form (0 and 1), but externally, data can be input \\nto a computer in the text form consisting of English \\nalphabets A–Z, a–z, numerals 0 – 9, and special symbols \\nlike @, #, etc. Data can be input in other languages too \\nor it can be \\nread from the files. The input data may \\nbe from different sources, hence it may be in different \\nformats. For example, an image is a collection of Red, \\nGreen, Blue (RGB) pixels, a video is made up of frames, \\nand a fee receipt is made of numeric and non-numeric \\ncharacters. Primarily, there are three types of data.\\n(A) Structured Data\\nData which follows a strict record structure and is easy \\nto comprehend is called structured data. Such data with \\npre-specified tabular format \\nmay be stored in a data file \\nto access in the future. Table 1.3 shows structured data \\nrelated to monthly attendance of students maintained \\nby the school.\\nTable 1.3 Structured data: Monthly attendance records of students\\nRoll No Name Month Attendance (in %)\\nR1 Mohan May 95\\nR2 Sohan May 75\\nR3 Sheen May 92\\nR4 Geet May 82\\nR5 Anita May 97\\nR1 Mohan July 98\\nR2 Sohan July 65\\nR3 Sheen July 85\\nR4 Geet July 94\\nR5 Anita July 85\\nCh 1.indd   11 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n12\\nIt is clear that such data is organised in row/column \\nformat and is easily understandable. Structured data \\nmay be sorted in ascending or descending order. In the \\nexample, attendance data is sorted in increasing order \\non the column ‘month’. Other examples of structured \\ndata include sales transactions, online railway ticket \\nbookings, ATM transactions, etc. \\n(B) Unstructured Data\\nData which are not organised \\nin a pre-defined record \\nformat is called unstructured data. Examples include \\naudio and video files, graphics, text documents, social \\nmedia posts, satellite images, etc. Figure 1.10 shows a \\nreport card with monthly attendance record details sent \\nto parents. Such data are unstructured as they consist \\nof textual contents as well as graphics, which do not \\nfollow a specific format.\\nFigure 1.10: Unstructured data: Monthly attendance record \\nSchool Logo\\nPrincipal’s SignatureGuardian’s Signature\\nAttended:\\nAttendance record for the month of July\\nCan you give some \\nmore examples of \\nunstructured data?\\nThink and Reflect\\nFigure 1.11: Semi-structured data: Month-wise total \\nattendance record maintained by the school\\nName: Mohan  Class: XI \\nName: Sohan  Class: XI \\nName: Sheen  Class: XI \\nName: Geet  Class: XI \\nName: Geet  \\nMonth: July  \\nMonth: July  \\nMonth: July  \\nMonth: May  \\nMonth: July  Class: XI \\nAttendance: 98 \\nAttendance: 65\\nAttendance: 85\\nAttendance: 82\\nAttendance: 94 \\n(C) Semi-structured Data\\nData which have no well-defined \\nstructure but \\nmaintains internal tags or markings to separate data \\nelements are called semi-structured data. Examples \\ninclude email document, HTML page, comma separated \\nvalues (csv file), etc. Figure 1.11 shows an example of \\nsemi-structured data containing student’s month-wise \\nattendance details. In this example, there is no specific \\nformat for each attendance \\nrecord. Here, each data value \\nis preceded by a tag (Name, \\nMonth, Class, Attendance) for \\nthe interpretation of the data \\nvalue while processing.\\nCh 1.indd   12 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n13\\n1.6.2 Data Capturing, Storage and Retrieval\\nTo process data, we need to first input or capture \\nthe data. This is followed by its storage in a file or a \\ndatabase so that it can be used in the future. Whenever \\ndata is to be processed, it is first retrieved from the \\nfile or database so that we can perform further actions \\non it.\\n(A) Data Capturing\\nIt involves the process of gathering data from different \\nsources in the digital form. This capturing may vary \\nfrom simple instruments like keyboard, barcode readers \\nused at shopping outlets (Figure 1.12), comments or \\nposts over social media, remote sensors on an earth \\norbiting satellite, \\netc. Sometimes, heterogeneity among \\ndata sources makes data capturing a complex task.\\n(B) Data Storage \\nIt is the process of storing \\nthe captured data for \\nprocessing later. Now-a-days data is being produced at \\na very high rate, and therefore data storage has become \\na challenging task. However, the decrease in the cost \\nof digital storage devices has helped in simplifying \\nthis task. There are numerous digital storage devices \\navailable in the market like as shown in Figure 1.7.\\nData keeps on increasing with time. Hence, the \\nstorage devices also require to be upgraded periodically. \\nIn large organisations, computers with larger and \\nfaster storage called data servers are deployed to store \\nvast amount of data. Such dedicated computers help \\nin processing data efficiently. However, the cost (both \\nhardware and software) of setting up a data server as \\nwell as its maintenance is high, especially for small \\norganisations and startups.\\n(C) Data Retrieval \\nIt involves fetching data from the storage devices, for its \\nprocessing as per the user requirement. As databases \\ngrow, the challenges involved in search and retrieval of \\nthe \\ndata in acceptable time, also increase. Minimising \\ndata access time is crucial for faster data processing.\\n1.6.3 Data Deletion and Recovery\\nOne of the biggest threats associated with digital data is \\nits deletion. The storage devices can malfunction or crash \\ndown resulting in the deletion of data stored. Users can \\nFigure 1.12: Capturing \\ndata using barcode reader\\nActivity 1.3\\nVisit some of the places \\nlike bank, automobile \\nshowroom, shopping \\nmall, tehsil office, etc., \\nand find out 2 – 3 names \\nof tools or instruments \\nused to capture data in \\ndigital format.\\nCh 1.indd   13 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n14\\naccidentally erase data from storage devices, or a hacker \\nor malware can delete the digital data intentionally.\\nDeleting digitally stored data means changing the \\ndetails of data at bit level, which can be very time-\\nconsuming. Therefore, when any data is simply deleted, \\nits address entry is marked as free, and that much \\nspace is shown as empty to the user, without actually \\ndeleting the data. \\nIn case data gets deleted accidentally or corrupted, \\nthere arises a need to recover the data. Recovery of the \\ndata is possible only if the contents or memory space \\nmarked as deleted have not been overwritten by some \\nother data. Data recovery is a process of retrieving \\ndeleted, corrupted and lost data from secondary \\nstorage devices.\\nThere are usually two security concerns associated \\nwith data. One is its deletion by some unauthorised \\nperson or software. These concerns can be avoided \\nby limiting access to the computer system and using \\npasswords for user accounts and files, wherever \\npossible. There is also an option of encrypting files to \\nprotect them from unwanted modification.\\nThe other concern is related to unwanted recovery of \\ndata by unauthorised user or software. Many a times, \\nwe discard our old, broken or malfunctioning storage \\ndevices without taking care to delete data. We assume \\nthat the contents of deleted files are permanently \\nremoved. However, if these storage devices fall into the \\nhands of mischief-mongers, they can easily recover \\ndata from such devices; this poses a threat to data \\nconfidentiality. This concern can be mitigated by using \\nproper tools to delete or shred data before disposing off \\nany old or faulty storage device.\\n1.7 Software \\nTill now, we have studied about the physical \\ncomponents or the hardware of the computer system. \\nBut the hardware is of no use on its own. Hardware \\nneeds to be operated by a set of instructions. These \\nsets of instructions are referred to as software. It is that \\ncomponent of a computer system, which we cannot \\nActivity 1.4\\nExplore possible ways \\nof recovering deleted \\ndata or data from a \\ncorrupted device. \\nActivity 1.5\\nCreate a test file and \\nthen delete it using \\nShift+Delete from \\nthe keyboard.

It comprises the instructions \\nand data to be processed using the computer hardware. \\nThe computer software and hardware complete any \\ntask together.\\nThe software comprises a set of instructions which \\non execution deliver the desired outcome. In other \\nwords, each software is written for some computational \\npurpose. Some examples of software include operating \\nsystems like Ubuntu or Windows 7/10, word processing \\ntool like LibreOffice or Microsoft Word, video player like \\nVLC Player, photo editors like GIMP and LibreOffice \\ndraw. A document or image stored on the hard disk or \\npen drive is referred to as a soft-copy. Once printed, the \\ndocument or an image is called a hard-copy. \\n1.7.1 Need of Software \\nThe sole purpose of a software is to make the computer \\nhardware useful and operational. A software knows how \\nto make different hardware components of a computer \\nwork and communicate with each other as well as with \\nthe end-user. We cannot instruct the hardware of a \\ncomputer directly. Software acts as an interface between \\nhuman users and the hardware.\\nDepending on the mode of interaction with hardware \\nand functions to be performed, the software can be broadly \\nclassified into three categories viz. (i) System software, \\n(ii) Programming tools and (iii) Application software.\\n1.7.2 System Software\\nThe software that provides the basic functionality \\nto operate a computer by interacting directly with its \\nconstituent hardware is termed as system software. A \\nsystem software knows how to operate and use different \\nhardware components of a computer. It provides services \\ndirectly to the end user, or to some other software. \\nExamples of system software include operating systems, \\nsystem utilities, device drivers, etc.\\n(A) Operating System\\nAs the name implies, the operating system is a system \\nsoftware that operates the \\ncomputer. An operating \\nsystem is the most basic system software, without \\nwhich other software cannot work. The operating system \\nmanages other application programs and provides \\nHardware refers to the \\nphysical components \\nof the computer system \\nwhich can be seen and \\ntouched. For example, \\nRAM, keyboard, \\nprinter, monitor, CPU, \\netc. On the other hand, \\nsoftware is a set of \\ninstructions and data \\nthat makes hardware \\nfunctional to complete \\nthe desired task. \\nCh 1.indd   15 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n16\\naccess and security to the users of the system. Some \\nof the popular operating systems are Windows, Linux, \\nMacintosh, Ubuntu, Fedora, Android, iOS, etc. \\n(B) System Utilities\\nSoftware used for maintenance and \\nconfiguration of the \\ncomputer system is called system utility. Some system \\nutilities are shipped with the operating system for \\nexample disk defragmentation tool, formatting utility, \\nsystem restore utility, etc. Another set of utilities are \\nthose which are not shipped with the operating system \\nbut are required to improve the performance of the \\nsystem, for example, anti-virus software, disk cleaner \\ntool, disk compression software, etc.\\n(C) Device Drivers\\nAs the name signifies, the \\npurpose of a device driver is to \\nensure proper functioning of a particular device. When \\nit comes to the overall working of a computer system, \\nthe operating system does the work. But everyday new \\ndevices and components are being added to a computer \\nsystem. It is not possible for the operating system alone \\nto operate all of the existing and new devices, where each \\ndevice has diverse characteristics. The responsibility \\nfor overall control, operation and management of a \\nparticular device at the hardware level is delegated to \\nits device driver.\\nThe device driver acts as an interface between the \\ndevice and the operating system. It provides required \\nservices by hiding the details \\nof operations performed at the \\nhardware level of the device. Just \\nlike a language translator, a device \\ndriver acts as a mediator between \\nthe operating system and the \\nattached device. The categorisation \\nof software is shown in Figure 1.13.\\n1.7.3 Programming Tools\\nIn order to get some work done \\nby the computer, we need to give \\ninstructions which are applied on the \\ninput data to get the desired outcome.\\nComputer languages are developed \\nfor writing these instructions.

Also, to write the instruction, code editors \\n(e.g., IDLE in Python) are needed. We will briefly describe \\nhere the programming languages, language translators \\nand program development tools.\\n(A) Classification of Programming Languages\\nIt is very difficult for \\na human being to write \\ninstructions in the form of 1s and 0s. So different types \\nof computer programming languages are developed to \\nsimplify the coding. Two major categories of computer \\nprogramming languages are low-level languages and \\nhigh-level languages.\\nLow-level languages are  machine  dependent languages \\nand include machine language and assembly language. \\nMachine language uses 1s and 0s to write instructions \\nwhich are directly understood and executed by the \\ncomputer. But writing a code in machine language is \\ndifficult as one has to remember all operation codes \\nand machine addresses. Also finding errors in the code \\nwritten in machine language is difficult. \\nTo simplify the writing of code, assembly language \\nwas developed that allowed usage of English-like words \\nand symbols instead of 1s and 0s. But one major \\ndrawback of writing a code in this language is that the \\ncode is computer specific, i.e., the code written for one \\ntype of CPU cannot be used for another type of CPU.\\nHigh level languages are machine independent and \\nare simpler to write code into. Instructions are using \\nEnglish like sentences and each high level language \\nfollows a set of rules, similar to natural languages. \\nHowever, these languages are not directly understood \\nby the computer. Hence, translators are needed to \\ntranslate high-level language codes into machine \\nlanguage. Examples of high level language include C++, \\nJava, Python, etc.\\n(B) Language Translators\\nAs the computer can understand only machine \\nlanguage, a translator is needed to convert program \\nwritten in assembly or high level language to machine \\nnoteS\\nnoteS\\nCh 1.indd   17 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n18\\nlanguage. The program code written in assembly or \\nhigh-level language is called source code. The source \\ncode is converted by a translator into the machine \\nunderstandable form called object (machine) code as \\ndepicted in Figure 1.14. \\nAs we have different types of computer languages, \\ndifferent translators are needed to convert the source \\ncode to machine code. The three types of translators \\nused in computing systems are assembler, compiler \\nand interpreter.\\nThe translator used to convert the code written \\nin assembly language to machine language is called \\nassembler. Each assembler can understand a specific \\nmicroprocessor instruction set only and hence, the \\nmachine code is not portable.\\nWe also need translators to convert codes written \\nin high level language (source code) to machine \\nunderstandable form (machine code) for execution by \\nthe computer. Compiler converts the source code into \\nmachine code. If the code follows all syntactic rules of \\nthe language, then it is executed by the computer. Once \\ntranslated, the compiler is not needed. \\nAn interpreter translates one line at a time instead of \\nthe whole program at one go. Interpreter takes one line, \\nconverts it into executable code if the line is syntactically \\ncorrect, and then it repeats these steps for all lines in \\nthe source code. Hence, interpreter is always needed \\nwhenever a source code is to be executed.\\n(C) Program Development Tools\\nWhenever we decide to write a program, we need a text \\neditor. An editor is a software \\nthat allows us to create a \\ntext file where we type instructions and store the file as \\nthe source code. Then an appropriate translator is used \\nto get the object code for execution. In order to simplify \\nthe program development, there are software called \\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) consisting \\nof text editor, building tools and debugger. A program \\ncan be typed, compiled and debugged from the IDE \\ndirectly. Besides Python IDLE, Netbeans, Eclipse, Atom, \\nLazarus are few other examples of IDEs. Debugger, as \\nthe name implies, is the software to detect and correct \\nerrors in the source code.\\nCode in machine \\nlanguage\\n(Object Code)\\nFigure 1.14: Translator to \\nconvert source code into \\nobject code\\nLanguage \\ntranslater\\nCode in high \\nlevel language\\n(Source Code)\\nCh 1.indd   18 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n19\\n1.7.4 Application Software\\nThe system software provides the core functionality of \\nthe computer system. However, different users need the \\ncomputer system for different purposes depending upon \\ntheir requirements. Hence, a new category of software \\nis needed to cater to different requirements of the end-\\nusers. This specific software that works on top of the \\nsystem software is termed as application software. There \\nare again two broad categories of application software — \\ngeneral purpose and customised application software.\\n(A)  General Purpose Software\\nThe application software developed for generic \\napplications, to cater to a bigger audience in general \\nare called general purpose software. Such ready-made \\napplication software can be used by end users as per \\ntheir requirements. For example, spreadsheet tool Calc \\nof LibreOffice can be used by any computer user to do \\ncalculation or to create account sheet. Adobe Photoshop, \\nGIMP, Mozilla web browser, iTunes, etc., fall in the \\ncategory of general purpose software.\\n(B) Customised Software\\nThese are custom or tailor-made application software, \\nthat are developed to meet the requirements of a specific \\norganisation or an individual. They are better suited to \\nthe needs of an individual or an organisation, considering \\nthat they are designed as per special requirements. Some \\nexamples of user-defined software include websites, \\nschool management software, accounting software, \\netc. It is similar to buying a piece of cloth and getting a \\ntailor-made garment with the fitting, colour, and fabric \\nof our choice.\\n1.7.5 Proprietary or Free and Open Source Software \\nThe developers of some application software provide \\ntheir source code as well as the software freely to the \\npublic, with an aim to develop and improve further with \\neach other’s help. Such software is known as Free and \\nOpen Source Software (FOSS). For example, the source \\ncode of operating system Ubuntu is freely accessible \\nfor anyone with the required knowledge to improve or \\nadd new functionality. More examples of FOSS include \\nPython, Libreoffice, Openoffice, Mozilla Firefox, etc. \\nSometimes, software are freely available for use but \\nA computer system \\ncan work without \\napplication software, \\nbut it cannot work \\nwithout system \\nsoftware. For example, \\nwe can use a computer \\neven if no word \\nprocessing software \\nis installed, but if no \\noperating system is \\ninstalled, we cannot \\nwork on the computer. \\nIn other words, the use \\nof computer is possible \\nin the absence of \\napplication software.\\nActivity 1.8\\nWith the help of your \\nteacher, install one \\nfree and open source  \\napplication software on \\nyour computer.\\nActivity 1.7\\nWith the help of your \\nteacher, install one \\napplication software in \\nyour computer.\\nCh 1.indd   19 21-May-19   4:32:01 PM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n20\\nsource code may not be available. Such software are \\ncalled freeware. Examples of freeware are Skype, Adobe \\nReader, etc. When the software to be used has to be \\npurchased from the vendor who has the copyright of the \\nsoftware, then it is a proprietary software. Examples of \\nproprietary software include Microsoft Windows, Tally, \\nQuickheal, etc. A software can be freeware or open \\nsource or proprietary software depending upon the \\nterms and conditions of the person or group who has \\ndeveloped and released that software.\\n1.8 operatIng SyStem\\nAn operating system (OS) can be considered to be a \\nresource manager which manages all the resources of a \\ncomputer, i.e., its hardware including CPU, RAM, Disk, \\nNetwork and other input-output devices. It also controls \\nvarious application software and device drivers, manages \\nsystem security and handles access by different users. \\nIt is the most important system software. Examples of \\npopular OS are Windows, Linux, Android, Macintosh \\nand so on.\\nThe primary objectives of an operating system are \\ntwo-fold. The first is to provide services for building and \\nrunning application programs. When an application \\nprogram needs to be run, it is the operating system \\nwhich loads that program into memory and allocates \\nit to the CPU for execution. When multiple application \\nprograms need to be run, the operating system decides \\nthe order of the execution. \\nThe second objective of an operating system is to \\nprovide an interface to the user through which the user \\ncan interact with the computer. A user interface is a \\nsoftware component which is a part of the operating \\nsystem and whose job is to take commands or inputs \\nfrom a user for the operating system to process.\\n1.8.1 OS User Interface\\nThere are different types of user interfaces each of which \\nprovides a different functionality. Some commonly used \\ninterfaces are shown in Figure 1.15.\\n(A) Command-based Interface\\nCommand-based interface requires a user to enter the \\ncommands to perform different tasks like creating, \\nFigure 1.15: Types of user  \\ninterface of OS\\nWhen a computer is \\nturned on, who brings \\nthe OS into RAM from \\nthe secondary storage?\\nThink and Reflect\\nCommand-based \\nInterface\\nGraphical User \\nInterface\\nTypes of User \\nInterface of \\nOperating System\\nTouch-based \\nInterface\\nVoice-based \\nInterface\\nGesture-based \\nInterface\\nCh 1.indd   20 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n21\\nopening, editing or deleting a file, etc. The user has to \\nremember the names of all such programs or specific \\ncommands which the operating system supports.\\nThe primary input device used by the user for \\ncommand based interface is the keyboard. Command \\nbased interface is often less interactive and usually \\nallows a user to run a single program at a time.\\nExamples of operating systems with command-based \\ninterface include MS-DOS and Unix.\\n(B) Graphical User Interface\\nGraphical User Interface (GUI) lets users run programs \\nor give instructions to the computer in the form of \\nicons, menus and other visual options. Icons usually \\nrepresent files \\nand programs stored on the computer \\nand windows represent running programs that the user \\nhas launched through the operating system. \\nThe input devices used to interact with the GUI \\ncommonly include the mouse and the keyboard. \\nExamples of operating systems with GUI interfaces \\ninclude Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu, Fedora and \\nMacintosh, among others.\\n(C) Touch-based Interface\\nToday smartphones, tablets and PCs allow users to \\ninteract with the system simply using the touch input. \\nUsing the touchscreen, a user provides inputs to the \\noperating system, which are interpreted by the OS as \\ncommands like opening an app, closing an app, dialing \\na number, scrolling across apps, etc. \\nExamples of popular operating systems with touch-\\nbased interfaces are Android and iOS. Windows \\n8.1 and 10 also \\nsupport touch-based interfaces on \\ntouchscreen devices. \\n(D) Voice-based Interface\\nModern computers have been designed to address the \\nneeds of all types of users including people with special \\nneeds and people who want to \\ninteract with computers \\nor smartphones while doing some other task. For users \\nwho cannot use the input devices like the mouse, \\nkeyboard, and touchscreens, modern operating systems \\nprovide other means of human-computer interaction. \\nUsers today can use voice-based commands to make \\na computer work in the desired way.

A program is \\nintended to \\ncarry out various tasks. A task in execution is known \\nas process. We can activate a system monitor program \\nthat provides information about the processes being \\nexecuted on a computer. In some systems it can be \\nactivated using Ctrl+Alt+Delete. It is the responsibility \\nof operating system to manage these processes and get \\nmultiple tasks completed in minimum time. As CPU is \\nthe main resource of computer system, its allocation \\namong processes is the most important service of the \\noperating system. Hence process management concerns \\nthe management of multiple processes, allocation \\nof required resources, and exchange of information \\namong processes.\\n(B) Memory Management\\nPrimary or main memory of a computer system is \\nusually limited. The main task of \\nmemory management \\nis to give (allocate) and take (free) memory from running \\nprocesses. Since there are multiple processes running \\nat a time, there arises a need to dynamically (on-the-go) \\nallocate and free memory to the processes. Operating \\nsystem should do it without affecting other processes \\nthat are already residing in the memory and once the \\nprocess is finished, it is again the responsibility of the \\noperating system to take the memory space back for re-\\nOperating system is called \\nresource manager as it \\nmanages different resources \\nlike main memory, CPU, \\nI/O devices, so that each \\nresource is used optimally \\nand system performance does \\nnot deteriorate.\\nCh 1.indd   22 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n23\\nutilisation. Hence, memory management concerns with \\nmanagement of main memory so that maximum memory \\nis occupied or utilised by large number of processes \\nwhile keeping track of each and every location within \\nthe memory as free or occupied. \\n(C) File Management \\nData and programs are stored \\nas files in the secondary \\nstorage of a computer system. File management involves \\nthe creation, updation, deletion and protection of these \\nfiles in the secondary memory. Protection is a crucial \\nfunction of an operating system, as multiple users can \\naccess and use a computer system. There must be a \\nmechanism in place that will stop users from accessing \\nfiles that belong to some other user and have not been \\nshared with them. File management system manages \\nsecondary memory, while memory management system \\nhandles the main memory of a computer system. \\n(D) Device Management \\nA computer system has many I/O devices and hardware \\nconnected to it. \\nOperating system manages these \\nheterogeneous devices that are interdependent. The \\noperating system interacts with the device driver and the \\nrelated software for a particular device. The operating \\nsystem must also provide the options for configuring \\na particular device, so that it may be used by an end \\nuser or some other device. Just like files, devices also \\nneed security measures and their access to different \\ndevices must be restricted by the operating system to \\nthe authorised users, software and other hardware only.\\nnoteS\\nSummary\\n• A computing device, also referred as computer, \\nprocesses the input data as per given instructions \\nto generate desired output. \\n• Computer system has four physical components \\nviz.\\n (i) CPU, (ii) Primary Memory, (iii) Input Device \\nand (iv) Output Devices.

A computer along with \\nadditional hardware and software together is called a \\ncomputer system.  \\nA computer system primarily comprises a central \\nprocessing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices \\nand storage devices. All these components function \\ntogether as a single unit to deliver the desired output. \\nA computer system comes in various forms and sizes. \\nIt can vary from a high-end server to personal desktop, \\nlaptop, tablet computer, or a smartphone. \\nFigure 1.1 shows the block diagram of a computer \\nsystem. The directed lines represent the flow of data  \\nand signal between the components. \\n1.1.1 Central Processing Unit (CPU)\\nIt is the electronic circuitry of a computer that carries \\nout the actual processing and usually referred as the \\nbrain of the computer. It is commonly called processor \\nalso. Physically, a CPU can be placed on one or more \\nmicrochips called integrated circuits (IC). The ICs \\ncomprise semiconductor materials. \\n“A computer would deserve \\nto be called intelligent if it \\ncould deceive a human into \\nbelieving that it was human.” \\n–Alan Turing\\nChapter 1 \\nComputer System\\nIn this chapter\\n » Introduction to \\nComputer System\\n » Evolution of \\nComputer \\n » Computer Memory \\n » Data Transfer \\nbetween Memory \\nand CPU\\n » Data and \\nInformation\\n » Microprocessors\\n » Software\\n » Operating System\\nFigure 1.1: Components of a computer system\\nSecondary \\nStorage Devices\\nInput \\nDevice Control Unit \\n(CU)\\nArithmetic Logic \\nUnit (ALU)\\nPrimary \\nMemory\\nOutput \\nDevice\\nCentral Processing \\nUnit (CPU)\\nCh 1.indd   1 08-Apr-19   11:36:15 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n2\\nThe CPU is given instructions and data through \\nprograms. The CPU then fetches the program and data \\nfrom the memory and performs arithmetic and logic \\noperations as per the given instructions and stores the \\nresult back to memory.\\nWhile processing, the CPU stores the data as well \\nas instructions in its local memory called registers. \\nRegisters are part of the CPU chip and they are limited \\nin size and number. Different registers are used for \\nstoring data, instructions or intermediate results. \\nOther than the registers, the CPU has two main \\ncomponents — Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control \\nUnit (CU). ALU performs all the arithmetic and logic \\noperations that need to be done as per the instruction in a \\nprogram. CU controls sequential instruction execution, \\ninterprets instructions and guides data flow through the \\ncomputer’s memory, ALU and input or output devices. \\nCPU is also popularly known as microprocessor. We will \\nstudy more about it in section 1.5. \\n1.1.2 Input Devices\\nThe devices through which control signals are sent \\nto a computer are termed as input devices. These \\ndevices convert the input data into a digital form that is \\nacceptable by the computer system. Some examples of \\ninput devices include keyboard, mouse, scanner, touch \\nscreen, etc., as shown in Figure 1.2. Specially designed \\nbraille keyboards are also available to help the visually \\nimpaired for entering data into a computer. Besides, we \\ncan now enter data through voice, for example, we can \\nuse Google voice search to search the web where we can \\ninput the search string through our voice.\\nData entered through input device is temporarily \\nstored in the main memory (also called RAM) of the \\ncomputer system. For permanent storage and future use, \\nthe data as well as instructions are stored permanently \\nin additional storage locations called secondary memory.\\n1.1.3 Output Devices\\nThe device that receives data from a computer system \\nfor display, physical production, etc., is called output \\ndevice. It converts digital information into human-\\nunderstandable form. For example, monitor, projector,   \\nheadphone, speaker, printer, etc. Some output devices \\nFigure 1.2: Input devices\\nScanner\\nTouch Screen\\nKeyboard\\nMouse\\nFigure 1.3: Output devices\\nSpeaker\\nPrinter\\n3D printer\\nDisplay monitor\\nCh 1.indd   2 08-Apr-19   11:36:15 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n3\\nare shown in Figure 1.3.

Three types of \\ncommonly used printers are inkjet, laserjet and dot \\nmatrix. Now-a-days, there is a new type of printer \\ncalled 3D-printer, which is used to build physical \\nreplica of a digital 3D design. These printers are being \\nused in manufacturing industries to create prototypes \\nof products.

Whenever we talk about the \\n‘memory’ of a computer system, we usually talk about the \\nmain or primary memory. The secondary memory (also \\ncalled storage device) is used to store data, instructions \\nand results permanently for future use.\\n1.3.1 Units of Memory\\nA computer system uses binary numbers to store and \\nprocess data. The binary digits 0 and 1, which are the \\nbasic units of memory, are called bits. Further, these \\nbits are grouped together to form words. A 4-bit word \\nis called a Nibble. Examples of nibble are 1001, 1010, \\n0010, etc. A two nibble word, i.e., 8-bit word is called a \\nbyte, for example, 01000110, 01111100, 10000001, etc.\\nLike any other standard unit, bytes are grouped \\ntogether to make bigger chunks or units of memory. \\nTable 1.1 shows different measurement units for digital \\ndata stored in storage devices.\\nCh 1.indd   5 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n6\\n1.3.2 Types of Memory\\nHuman beings memorise many things over a lifetime, and \\nrecall from memory to make a decision or some action.\\nHowever, we do not rely on our memory completely, and \\nwe make notes and store important data and information \\nusing other media, such as notebook, manual, journal, \\ndocument, etc. Similarly, computers have two types of \\nmemory   — primary and secondary. \\n(A) Primary Memory\\nPrimary memory is an essential component of \\na \\ncomputer system. Program and data are loaded into the \\nprimary memory before processing. The CPU interacts \\ndirectly with the primary memory to perform read or \\nwrite operation. It is of two types viz. (i) Random Access \\nMemory (RAM) and (ii) Read Only Memory (ROM).\\nRAM is volatile, i.e., as long as the power is supplied \\nto the computer, it retains the data in it. But as soon \\nas the power supply is turned off, all the contents of \\nRAM are wiped out. It is used to store data temporarily \\nwhile the computer is working. Whenever the computer \\nis started or a software application is launched, the \\nrequired program and data are loaded into RAM \\nfor processing. RAM is usually referred to as main \\nmemory and it is faster than the secondary memory or \\nstorage devices.\\nOn the other hand, ROM is non-volatile, which \\nmeans its contents are not lost even when the power is \\nturned off. It is used as a small but faster permanent \\nstorage for the contents which are rarely changed. For \\nexample, the startup program (boot loader) that loads \\nthe operating system into primary memory, is stored  \\nin ROM.\\n(B) Cache Memory\\nRAM is faster than secondary storage, but not as \\nfast \\nas a computer processor. So, because of RAM, a CPU \\nTable 1.1 Measurement units for digital data\\nUnit Description Unit Description\\nKB (Kilobyte) 1 KB = 1024 Bytes PB (Petabyte) 1 PB = 1024 TB\\nMB (Megabyte) 1 MB = 1024 KB EB (Exabyte) 1 EB = 1024 PB\\nGB (Gigabyte) 1 GB = 1024 MB ZB (Zettabyte) 1 ZB = 1024 EB\\nTB (Terabyte) 1 TB = 1024 GB YB (Yottabyte) 1 YB = 1024 ZB\\nSuppose there is a \\ncomputer with RAM \\nbut no secondary \\nstorage. Can we install \\na software on that \\ncomputer?\\nThink and Reflect\\nCh 1.indd   6 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n7\\nmay have to slow down. To speed up the operations of \\nthe CPU, a very high speed memory is placed between \\nthe CPU and the primary memory known as cache. It \\nstores the copies of the data from frequently accessed \\nprimary memory locations, thus, reducing the average \\ntime required to access data from primary memory. \\nWhen the CPU needs some data, it first examines the \\ncache. In case the requirement is met, it is read from \\nthe cache, otherwise the primary memory is accessed.\\n(C) Secondary Memory\\nPrimary memory has limited storage \\ncapacity and \\nis either volatile (RAM) or read-only (ROM). Thus, a \\ncomputer system needs auxiliary or secondary memory \\nto permanently store the data or instructions for \\nfuture use. The secondary memory is non-volatile and \\nhas larger storage capacity than primary memory. It \\nis slower and cheaper than the main memory. But, it \\ncannot be accessed directly by the CPU. Contents of \\nsecondary storage need to be first brought into the main \\nmemory for the CPU to access. Examples of secondary \\nmemory devices include Hard Disk Drive (HDD), CD/\\nDVD, Memory Card, etc., as shown in Figure 1.7.\\nHowever, these days, there are secondary storage \\ndevices like SSD which support very fast data transfer \\nspeed as compared to earlier HDDs. Also, data transfer \\nbetween computers have become easier and simple due \\nto the availability of small-sized and portable flash or \\npen drives. \\n1.4 data tranSfer between memory and cpu\\nData need to be transferred between the CPU and \\nprimary memory as well as between the primary and \\nsecondary memory. \\nData are transferred between different components of \\na computer system using physical wires called bus. For \\nexample, bus is used for data transfer between a USB \\nport and hard disk or between a hard disk and main \\nmemory. Bus is of three types — (i) Data bus to transfer \\ndata between different components, (ii) Address bus to \\ntransfer addresses between CPU and main memory. \\nThe address of the memory location that the CPU wants \\nto \\nread or write from is specified in the address bus, \\nFigure 1.7: Storage devices \\nPen \\nDrive\\nCD/DVD\\nCh 1.indd   7 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\"Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n8\\nand (iii) Control bus to communicate  \\ncontrol signals between different \\ncomponents of a computer. All these \\nthree buses collectively make the \\nsystem bus, as shown in Figure 1.8.\\nAs the CPU interacts directly with \\nmain memory, any data entered from \\ninput device or the data to be accessed \\nfrom hard disk needs to be placed in the \\nmain memory for further processing. \\nThe data is then transferred between \\nCPU and main memory using bus.\\nThe CPU places on the address bus, the address of \\nthe main memory location from which it wants to read \\ndata or to write data. While executing the instructions, \\nthe CPU specifies the read or write control signal through \\nthe control bus. \\nAs the CPU may require to read data from main \\nmemory or write data to main memory, a data bus is \\nbidirectional. But the control bus and address bus are \\nunidirectional. To write data into memory, the CPU \\nplaces the data on the data bus, which is then written \\nto the specific address provided through the address \\nbus. In case of read operation, the CPU specifies the \\naddress, and the data is placed on the data bus by a \\ndedicated hardware, called memory controller. The \\nmemory controller manages the flow of data into and \\nout of the computer's main memory.\\n1.5 mIcroproceSSorS\\nIn earlier days, a computer's CPU used to occupy a large \\nroom or  multiple cabinets. However, with advancement \\nin technology, the physical size of CPU has reduced and \\nit is now possible to place a CPU on a single microchip \\nonly. A processor (CPU) which is implemented on a \\nsingle microchip is called microprocessor. Nowadays, \\nalmost all the CPUs are microprocessors. Hence, the \\nterms are used synonymously for practical purpose.\\nMicroprocessor  is a small-sized electronic component \\ninside a computer that carries out various tasks involved \\nin data processing as well as arithmetic and logical \\noperations. These days, a microprocessor is built over \\nan integrated circuit comprising millions of small \\ncomponents like resistors, transistors and diodes.\\n Figure 1.8: Data transfer between components through \\nsystem bus\\nCh 1.indd   8 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n9\\nMicroprocessors have evolved over time in terms \\nof their increased processing capability, decreasing \\nphysical size and reduced cost.

Earlier, a word \\nwas of 8 \\nbits, as it was the maximum limit at that \\ntime. At present, the minimum word size is 16 bits and \\nmaximum word size is 64 bits.\\n(B) Memory Size\\nDepending upon the word size, the size \\nof RAM varies. \\nInitially, RAM was very small (4MB) due to 4/8 bits word \\nsize. As word size increased to 64 bits, it has become \\nfeasible to use RAM of size upto 16 Exabytes (EB).\\n(C) Clock Speed\\nComputers have an internal clock that generates \\npulses \\n(signals) at regular intervals of time. Clock speed simply \\nmeans the number of pulses generated per second by the \\nCh 1.indd   9 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n10\\nclock inside a computer. The clock speed indicates the \\nspeed at which the computer can execute instructions.\\nEarlier, it was measured in Hertz (Hz) and Kilohertz \\n(kHz). But with advancement in technology and chip \\ndensity, it is now measured in Gigahertz (GHz), i.e., \\nbillions of pulses per second.\\n(D) Cores\\nCore is a basic computation unit of the CPU. Earlier \\nprocessors had only one computation unit, thereby \\ncapable of performing only  one task at a time. With the \\nadvent of multicore processor, it has become possible \\nfor the computer to \\nexecute multiple tasks, thereby \\nincreasing the system’s performance. CPU with two, \\nfour, and eight cores is called dual-core, quad-core and \\nocta-core processor, respectively. \\n1.5.2 Microcontrollers\\nThe microcontroller is a small computing device which \\nhas a CPU, a fixed amount of RAM, ROM and other \\nperipherals all embedded on a single chip as compared \\nto microprocessor that has only a CPU on the chip. The \\nstructure of a microcontroller is shown in Figure 1.9. \\nKeyboard, mouse, washing machine, digital camera, \\npendrive, remote controller, microwave are few examples \\nof microcontrollers. As these are designed for specific \\ntasks only, hence their size as well as cost is reduced. \\nBecause of the very small size of the \\nmicrocontroller, it is embedded in another device \\nor system to perform a specific functionality. For \\nexample, the microcontroller in a fully automatic \\nwashing machine is used to control the washing cycle \\nwithout any human intervention. The cycle starts \\nwith the filling of water, after which the clothes are \\nsoaked and washed; thereafter the water is drained \\nand the clothes are spin dry. The simple use of \\nmicrocontroller has permitted repetitive execution \\nof tedious tasks automatically without any human \\nintervention, thereby saving precious time.\\n1.6 data and InformatIon\\nA computer is primarily for processing data. A computer \\nsystem considers everything as data, be it instructions, \\npictures, songs, videos, documents, etc. Data can also be \\nFigure 1.9: Structure of \\nmicrocontroller\\nClock CPU Memory\\nBus System\\nInput Output\\nI/O-ports\\nActivity 1.2\\nFind out the clock speed \\nof the microprocessor \\nof your computer and \\ncompare with that of \\nyour peers?\\nCh 1.indd   10 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n11\\nraw and unorganised facts that are processed to get \\nmeaningful information.\\nSo understanding the concept of data along with \\nits different types is crucial to understand the overall \\nfunctioning of a computer. Sometimes people use the \\nterms data, information and knowledge interchangeably, \\nwhich is incorrect. \\n1.6.1 Data and Its Types\\nA computer system has many input devices, which \\nprovide it with raw data in the form of facts, concepts, \\ninstructions, etc., Internally everything is stored in \\nbinary form (0 and 1), but externally, data can be input \\nto a computer in the text form consisting of English \\nalphabets A–Z, a–z, numerals 0 – 9, and special symbols \\nlike @, #, etc. Data can be input in other languages too \\nor it can be \\nread from the files. The input data may \\nbe from different sources, hence it may be in different \\nformats. For example, an image is a collection of Red, \\nGreen, Blue (RGB) pixels, a video is made up of frames, \\nand a fee receipt is made of numeric and non-numeric \\ncharacters. Primarily, there are three types of data.\\n(A) Structured Data\\nData which follows a strict record structure and is easy \\nto comprehend is called structured data. Such data with \\npre-specified tabular format \\nmay be stored in a data file \\nto access in the future. Table 1.3 shows structured data \\nrelated to monthly attendance of students maintained \\nby the school.\\nTable 1.3 Structured data: Monthly attendance records of students\\nRoll No Name Month Attendance (in %)\\nR1 Mohan May 95\\nR2 Sohan May 75\\nR3 Sheen May 92\\nR4 Geet May 82\\nR5 Anita May 97\\nR1 Mohan July 98\\nR2 Sohan July 65\\nR3 Sheen July 85\\nR4 Geet July 94\\nR5 Anita July 85\\nCh 1.indd   11 08-Apr-19   11:36:16 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n12\\nIt is clear that such data is organised in row/column \\nformat and is easily understandable. Structured data \\nmay be sorted in ascending or descending order. In the \\nexample, attendance data is sorted in increasing order \\non the column ‘month’. Other examples of structured \\ndata include sales transactions, online railway ticket \\nbookings, ATM transactions, etc. \\n(B) Unstructured Data\\nData which are not organised \\nin a pre-defined record \\nformat is called unstructured data. Examples include \\naudio and video files, graphics, text documents, social \\nmedia posts, satellite images, etc. Figure 1.10 shows a \\nreport card with monthly attendance record details sent \\nto parents. Such data are unstructured as they consist \\nof textual contents as well as graphics, which do not \\nfollow a specific format.\\nFigure 1.10: Unstructured data: Monthly attendance record \\nSchool Logo\\nPrincipal’s SignatureGuardian’s Signature\\nAttended:\\nAttendance record for the month of July\\nCan you give some \\nmore examples of \\nunstructured data?\\nThink and Reflect\\nFigure 1.11: Semi-structured data: Month-wise total \\nattendance record maintained by the school\\nName: Mohan  Class: XI \\nName: Sohan  Class: XI \\nName: Sheen  Class: XI \\nName: Geet  Class: XI \\nName: Geet  \\nMonth: July  \\nMonth: July  \\nMonth: July  \\nMonth: May  \\nMonth: July  Class: XI \\nAttendance: 98 \\nAttendance: 65\\nAttendance: 85\\nAttendance: 82\\nAttendance: 94 \\n(C) Semi-structured Data\\nData which have no well-defined \\nstructure but \\nmaintains internal tags or markings to separate data \\nelements are called semi-structured data.

This is followed by its storage in a file or a \\ndatabase so that it can be used in the future. Whenever \\ndata is to be processed, it is first retrieved from the \\nfile or database so that we can perform further actions \\non it.\\n(A) Data Capturing\\nIt involves the process of gathering data from different \\nsources in the digital form. This capturing may vary \\nfrom simple instruments like keyboard, barcode readers \\nused at shopping outlets (Figure 1.12), comments or \\nposts over social media, remote sensors on an earth \\norbiting satellite, \\netc. Sometimes, heterogeneity among \\ndata sources makes data capturing a complex task.\\n(B) Data Storage \\nIt is the process of storing \\nthe captured data for \\nprocessing later. Now-a-days data is being produced at \\na very high rate, and therefore data storage has become \\na challenging task. However, the decrease in the cost \\nof digital storage devices has helped in simplifying \\nthis task. There are numerous digital storage devices \\navailable in the market like as shown in Figure 1.7.\\nData keeps on increasing with time. Hence, the \\nstorage devices also require to be upgraded periodically. \\nIn large organisations, computers with larger and \\nfaster storage called data servers are deployed to store \\nvast amount of data. Such dedicated computers help \\nin processing data efficiently. However, the cost (both \\nhardware and software) of setting up a data server as \\nwell as its maintenance is high, especially for small \\norganisations and startups.\\n(C) Data Retrieval \\nIt involves fetching data from the storage devices, for its \\nprocessing as per the user requirement. As databases \\ngrow, the challenges involved in search and retrieval of \\nthe \\ndata in acceptable time, also increase. Minimising \\ndata access time is crucial for faster data processing.\\n1.6.3 Data Deletion and Recovery\\nOne of the biggest threats associated with digital data is \\nits deletion. The storage devices can malfunction or crash \\ndown resulting in the deletion of data stored. Users can \\nFigure 1.12: Capturing \\ndata using barcode reader\\nActivity 1.3\\nVisit some of the places \\nlike bank, automobile \\nshowroom, shopping \\nmall, tehsil office, etc., \\nand find out 2 – 3 names \\nof tools or instruments \\nused to capture data in \\ndigital format.\\nCh 1.indd   13 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n14\\naccidentally erase data from storage devices, or a hacker \\nor malware can delete the digital data intentionally.\\nDeleting digitally stored data means changing the \\ndetails of data at bit level, which can be very time-\\nconsuming. Therefore, when any data is simply deleted, \\nits address entry is marked as free, and that much \\nspace is shown as empty to the user, without actually \\ndeleting the data. \\nIn case data gets deleted accidentally or corrupted, \\nthere arises a need to recover the data. Recovery of the \\ndata is possible only if the contents or memory space \\nmarked as deleted have not been overwritten by some \\nother data. Data recovery is a process of retrieving \\ndeleted, corrupted and lost data from secondary \\nstorage devices.\\nThere are usually two security concerns associated \\nwith data. One is its deletion by some unauthorised \\nperson or software. These concerns can be avoided \\nby limiting access to the computer system and using \\npasswords for user accounts and files, wherever \\npossible. There is also an option of encrypting files to \\nprotect them from unwanted modification.\\nThe other concern is related to unwanted recovery of \\ndata by unauthorised user or software. Many a times, \\nwe discard our old, broken or malfunctioning storage \\ndevices without taking care to delete data. We assume \\nthat the contents of deleted files are permanently \\nremoved. However, if these storage devices fall into the \\nhands of mischief-mongers, they can easily recover \\ndata from such devices; this poses a threat to data \\nconfidentiality. This concern can be mitigated by using \\nproper tools to delete or shred data before disposing off \\nany old or faulty storage device.\\n1.7 Software \\nTill now, we have studied about the physical \\ncomponents or the hardware of the computer system. \\nBut the hardware is of no use on its own. Hardware \\nneeds to be operated by a set of instructions. These \\nsets of instructions are referred to as software. It is that \\ncomponent of a computer system, which we cannot \\nActivity 1.4\\nExplore possible ways \\nof recovering deleted \\ndata or data from a \\ncorrupted device. \\nActivity 1.5\\nCreate a test file and \\nthen delete it using \\nShift+Delete from \\nthe keyboard.

It comprises the instructions \\nand data to be processed using the computer hardware. \\nThe computer software and hardware complete any \\ntask together.\\nThe software comprises a set of instructions which \\non execution deliver the desired outcome. In other \\nwords, each software is written for some computational \\npurpose. Some examples of software include operating \\nsystems like Ubuntu or Windows 7/10, word processing \\ntool like LibreOffice or Microsoft Word, video player like \\nVLC Player, photo editors like GIMP and LibreOffice \\ndraw. A document or image stored on the hard disk or \\npen drive is referred to as a soft-copy. Once printed, the \\ndocument or an image is called a hard-copy. \\n1.7.1 Need of Software \\nThe sole purpose of a software is to make the computer \\nhardware useful and operational. A software knows how \\nto make different hardware components of a computer \\nwork and communicate with each other as well as with \\nthe end-user. We cannot instruct the hardware of a \\ncomputer directly. Software acts as an interface between \\nhuman users and the hardware.\\nDepending on the mode of interaction with hardware \\nand functions to be performed, the software can be broadly \\nclassified into three categories viz. (i) System software, \\n(ii) Programming tools and (iii) Application software.\\n1.7.2 System Software\\nThe software that provides the basic functionality \\nto operate a computer by interacting directly with its \\nconstituent hardware is termed as system software. A \\nsystem software knows how to operate and use different \\nhardware components of a computer. It provides services \\ndirectly to the end user, or to some other software. \\nExamples of system software include operating systems, \\nsystem utilities, device drivers, etc.\\n(A) Operating System\\nAs the name implies, the operating system is a system \\nsoftware that operates the \\ncomputer. An operating \\nsystem is the most basic system software, without \\nwhich other software cannot work. The operating system \\nmanages other application programs and provides \\nHardware refers to the \\nphysical components \\nof the computer system \\nwhich can be seen and \\ntouched. For example, \\nRAM, keyboard, \\nprinter, monitor, CPU, \\netc. On the other hand, \\nsoftware is a set of \\ninstructions and data \\nthat makes hardware \\nfunctional to complete \\nthe desired task. \\nCh 1.indd   15 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n16\\naccess and security to the users of the system. Some \\nof the popular operating systems are Windows, Linux, \\nMacintosh, Ubuntu, Fedora, Android, iOS, etc. \\n(B) System Utilities\\nSoftware used for maintenance and \\nconfiguration of the \\ncomputer system is called system utility. Some system \\nutilities are shipped with the operating system for \\nexample disk defragmentation tool, formatting utility, \\nsystem restore utility, etc. Another set of utilities are \\nthose which are not shipped with the operating system \\nbut are required to improve the performance of the \\nsystem, for example, anti-virus software, disk cleaner \\ntool, disk compression software, etc.\\n(C) Device Drivers\\nAs the name signifies, the \\npurpose of a device driver is to \\nensure proper functioning of a particular device. When \\nit comes to the overall working of a computer system, \\nthe operating system does the work. But everyday new \\ndevices and components are being added to a computer \\nsystem. It is not possible for the operating system alone \\nto operate all of the existing and new devices, where each \\ndevice has diverse characteristics. The responsibility \\nfor overall control, operation and management of a \\nparticular device at the hardware level is delegated to \\nits device driver.\\nThe device driver acts as an interface between the \\ndevice and the operating system. It provides required \\nservices by hiding the details \\nof operations performed at the \\nhardware level of the device. Just \\nlike a language translator, a device \\ndriver acts as a mediator between \\nthe operating system and the \\nattached device. The categorisation \\nof software is shown in Figure 1.13.\\n1.7.3 Programming Tools\\nIn order to get some work done \\nby the computer, we need to give \\ninstructions which are applied on the \\ninput data to get the desired outcome.\\nComputer languages are developed \\nfor writing these instructions. Figure 1.13: Categorisation of software\\nActivity 1.6\\nAsk your teacher to \\nhelp you locate any two \\ndevice drivers installed \\non your computer.\\nCh 1.indd   16 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n17\\nIt is important to understand here that computers and \\nhumans understand completely different languages. \\nWhile humans are able to write programs in high-level \\nlanguage, computers understand machine language. \\nThere is a continuous need for conversion from high \\nlevel to machine level language, for which translators \\nare needed. Also, to write the instruction, code editors \\n(e.g., IDLE in Python) are needed. We will briefly describe \\nhere the programming languages, language translators \\nand program development tools.\\n(A) Classification of Programming Languages\\nIt is very difficult for \\na human being to write \\ninstructions in the form of 1s and 0s. So different types \\nof computer programming languages are developed to \\nsimplify the coding. Two major categories of computer \\nprogramming languages are low-level languages and \\nhigh-level languages.\\nLow-level languages are  machine  dependent languages \\nand include machine language and assembly language. \\nMachine language uses 1s and 0s to write instructions \\nwhich are directly understood and executed by the \\ncomputer. But writing a code in machine language is \\ndifficult as one has to remember all operation codes \\nand machine addresses. Also finding errors in the code \\nwritten in machine language is difficult. \\nTo simplify the writing of code, assembly language \\nwas developed that allowed usage of English-like words \\nand symbols instead of 1s and 0s. But one major \\ndrawback of writing a code in this language is that the \\ncode is computer specific, i.e., the code written for one \\ntype of CPU cannot be used for another type of CPU.\\nHigh level languages are machine independent and \\nare simpler to write code into. Instructions are using \\nEnglish like sentences and each high level language \\nfollows a set of rules, similar to natural languages. \\nHowever, these languages are not directly understood \\nby the computer. Hence, translators are needed to \\ntranslate high-level language codes into machine \\nlanguage. Examples of high level language include C++, \\nJava, Python, etc.\\n(B) Language Translators\\nAs the computer can understand only machine \\nlanguage, a translator is needed to convert program \\nwritten in assembly or high level language to machine \\nnoteS\\nnoteS\\nCh 1.indd   17 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n18\\nlanguage. The program code written in assembly or \\nhigh-level language is called source code. The source \\ncode is converted by a translator into the machine \\nunderstandable form called object (machine) code as \\ndepicted in Figure 1.14. \\nAs we have different types of computer languages, \\ndifferent translators are needed to convert the source \\ncode to machine code. The three types of translators \\nused in computing systems are assembler, compiler \\nand interpreter.\\nThe translator used to convert the code written \\nin assembly language to machine language is called \\nassembler. Each assembler can understand a specific \\nmicroprocessor instruction set only and hence, the \\nmachine code is not portable.\\nWe also need translators to convert codes written \\nin high level language (source code) to machine \\nunderstandable form (machine code) for execution by \\nthe computer. Compiler converts the source code into \\nmachine code. If the code follows all syntactic rules of \\nthe language, then it is executed by the computer. Once \\ntranslated, the compiler is not needed. \\nAn interpreter translates one line at a time instead of \\nthe whole program at one go. Interpreter takes one line, \\nconverts it into executable code if the line is syntactically \\ncorrect, and then it repeats these steps for all lines in \\nthe source code. Hence, interpreter is always needed \\nwhenever a source code is to be executed.\\n(C) Program Development Tools\\nWhenever we decide to write a program, we need a text \\neditor. An editor is a software \\nthat allows us to create a \\ntext file where we type instructions and store the file as \\nthe source code. Then an appropriate translator is used \\nto get the object code for execution. In order to simplify \\nthe program development, there are software called \\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) consisting \\nof text editor, building tools and debugger. A program \\ncan be typed, compiled and debugged from the IDE \\ndirectly. Besides Python IDLE, Netbeans, Eclipse, Atom, \\nLazarus are few other examples of IDEs. Debugger, as \\nthe name implies, is the software to detect and correct \\nerrors in the source code.\\nCode in machine \\nlanguage\\n(Object Code)\\nFigure 1.14: Translator to \\nconvert source code into \\nobject code\\nLanguage \\ntranslater\\nCode in high \\nlevel language\\n(Source Code)\\nCh 1.indd   18 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n19\\n1.7.4 Application Software\\nThe system software provides the core functionality of \\nthe computer system. However, different users need the \\ncomputer system for different purposes depending upon \\ntheir requirements. Hence, a new category of software \\nis needed to cater to different requirements of the end-\\nusers. This specific software that works on top of the \\nsystem software is termed as application software. There \\nare again two broad categories of application software — \\ngeneral purpose and customised application software.\\n(A)  General Purpose Software\\nThe application software developed for generic \\napplications, to cater to a bigger audience in general \\nare called general purpose software. Such ready-made \\napplication software can be used by end users as per \\ntheir requirements. For example, spreadsheet tool Calc \\nof LibreOffice can be used by any computer user to do \\ncalculation or to create account sheet. Adobe Photoshop, \\nGIMP, Mozilla web browser, iTunes, etc., fall in the \\ncategory of general purpose software.\\n(B) Customised Software\\nThese are custom or tailor-made application software, \\nthat are developed to meet the requirements of a specific \\norganisation or an individual. They are better suited to \\nthe needs of an individual or an organisation, considering \\nthat they are designed as per special requirements. Some \\nexamples of user-defined software include websites, \\nschool management software, accounting software, \\netc. It is similar to buying a piece of cloth and getting a \\ntailor-made garment with the fitting, colour, and fabric \\nof our choice.\\n1.7.5 Proprietary or Free and Open Source Software \\nThe developers of some application software provide \\ntheir source code as well as the software freely to the \\npublic, with an aim to develop and improve further with \\neach other’s help. Such software is known as Free and \\nOpen Source Software (FOSS). For example, the source \\ncode of operating system Ubuntu is freely accessible \\nfor anyone with the required knowledge to improve or \\nadd new functionality. More examples of FOSS include \\nPython, Libreoffice, Openoffice, Mozilla Firefox, etc. \\nSometimes, software are freely available for use but \\nA computer system \\ncan work without \\napplication software, \\nbut it cannot work \\nwithout system \\nsoftware. For example, \\nwe can use a computer \\neven if no word \\nprocessing software \\nis installed, but if no \\noperating system is \\ninstalled, we cannot \\nwork on the computer. \\nIn other words, the use \\nof computer is possible \\nin the absence of \\napplication software.\\nActivity 1.8\\nWith the help of your \\nteacher, install one \\nfree and open source  \\napplication software on \\nyour computer.\\nActivity 1.7\\nWith the help of your \\nteacher, install one \\napplication software in \\nyour computer.\\nCh 1.indd   19 21-May-19   4:32:01 PM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n20\\nsource code may not be available. Such software are \\ncalled freeware. Examples of freeware are Skype, Adobe \\nReader, etc. When the software to be used has to be \\npurchased from the vendor who has the copyright of the \\nsoftware, then it is a proprietary software. Examples of \\nproprietary software include Microsoft Windows, Tally, \\nQuickheal, etc. A software can be freeware or open \\nsource or proprietary software depending upon the \\nterms and conditions of the person or group who has \\ndeveloped and released that software.\\n1.8 operatIng SyStem\\nAn operating system (OS) can be considered to be a \\nresource manager which manages all the resources of a \\ncomputer, i.e., its hardware including CPU, RAM, Disk, \\nNetwork and other input-output devices. It also controls \\nvarious application software and device drivers, manages \\nsystem security and handles access by different users. \\nIt is the most important system software. Examples of \\npopular OS are Windows, Linux, Android, Macintosh \\nand so on.\\nThe primary objectives of an operating system are \\ntwo-fold. The first is to provide services for building and \\nrunning application programs. When an application \\nprogram needs to be run, it is the operating system \\nwhich loads that program into memory and allocates \\nit to the CPU for execution. When multiple application \\nprograms need to be run, the operating system decides \\nthe order of the execution. \\nThe second objective of an operating system is to \\nprovide an interface to the user through which the user \\ncan interact with the computer. A user interface is a \\nsoftware component which is a part of the operating \\nsystem and whose job is to take commands or inputs \\nfrom a user for the operating system to process.\\n1.8.1 OS User Interface\\nThere are different types of user interfaces each of which \\nprovides a different functionality. Some commonly used \\ninterfaces are shown in Figure 1.15.\\n(A) Command-based Interface\\nCommand-based interface requires a user to enter the \\ncommands to perform different tasks like creating, \\nFigure 1.15: Types of user  \\ninterface of OS\\nWhen a computer is \\nturned on, who brings \\nthe OS into RAM from \\nthe secondary storage?\\nThink and Reflect\\nCommand-based \\nInterface\\nGraphical User \\nInterface\\nTypes of User \\nInterface of \\nOperating System\\nTouch-based \\nInterface\\nVoice-based \\nInterface\\nGesture-based \\nInterface\\nCh 1.indd   20 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n21\\nopening, editing or deleting a file, etc. The user has to \\nremember the names of all such programs or specific \\ncommands which the operating system supports.\\nThe primary input device used by the user for \\ncommand based interface is the keyboard. Command \\nbased interface is often less interactive and usually \\nallows a user to run a single program at a time.\\nExamples of operating systems with command-based \\ninterface include MS-DOS and Unix.\\n(B) Graphical User Interface\\nGraphical User Interface (GUI) lets users run programs \\nor give instructions to the computer in the form of \\nicons, menus and other visual options. Icons usually \\nrepresent files \\nand programs stored on the computer \\nand windows represent running programs that the user \\nhas launched through the operating system. \\nThe input devices used to interact with the GUI \\ncommonly include the mouse and the keyboard. \\nExamples of operating systems with GUI interfaces \\ninclude Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu, Fedora and \\nMacintosh, among others.\\n(C) Touch-based Interface\\nToday smartphones, tablets and PCs allow users to \\ninteract with the system simply using the touch input. \\nUsing the touchscreen, a user provides inputs to the \\noperating system, which are interpreted by the OS as \\ncommands like opening an app, closing an app, dialing \\na number, scrolling across apps, etc. \\nExamples of popular operating systems with touch-\\nbased interfaces are Android and iOS. Windows \\n8.1 and 10 also \\nsupport touch-based interfaces on \\ntouchscreen devices. \\n(D) Voice-based Interface\\nModern computers have been designed to address the \\nneeds of all types of users including people with special \\nneeds and people who want to \\ninteract with computers \\nor smartphones while doing some other task. For users \\nwho cannot use the input devices like the mouse, \\nkeyboard, and touchscreens, modern operating systems \\nprovide other means of human-computer interaction. \\nUsers today can use voice-based commands to make \\na computer work in the desired way. Some operating \\nnoteS\\nCh 1.indd   21 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='Computer SCienCe – ClaSS xi\\n22\\nsystems which provide voice-based control to users \\ninclude iOS (Siri), Android (Google Now or “OK Google”), \\nMicrosoft Windows 10 (Cortana) and so on.\\n(E) Gesture-based Interface\\nSome smartphones based on Android and iOS as well \\nas laptops let users interact with the devices using \\ngestures like waving, tilting, \\neye motion and shaking. \\nThis technology is evolving faster and it has promising \\npotential for application in gaming, medicine and \\nother areas.\\n1.8.2 Functions of Operating System\\nNow let us explore the important services and tasks \\nthat an operating system provides for managing the \\ncomputer system.\\n(A) Process Management\\nWhile a computer system is operational, different tasks \\nare running simultaneously. A program is \\nintended to \\ncarry out various tasks. A task in execution is known \\nas process. We can activate a system monitor program \\nthat provides information about the processes being \\nexecuted on a computer. In some systems it can be \\nactivated using Ctrl+Alt+Delete. It is the responsibility \\nof operating system to manage these processes and get \\nmultiple tasks completed in minimum time. As CPU is \\nthe main resource of computer system, its allocation \\namong processes is the most important service of the \\noperating system. Hence process management concerns \\nthe management of multiple processes, allocation \\nof required resources, and exchange of information \\namong processes.\\n(B) Memory Management\\nPrimary or main memory of a computer system is \\nusually limited. The main task of \\nmemory management \\nis to give (allocate) and take (free) memory from running \\nprocesses. Since there are multiple processes running \\nat a time, there arises a need to dynamically (on-the-go) \\nallocate and free memory to the processes. Operating \\nsystem should do it without affecting other processes \\nthat are already residing in the memory and once the \\nprocess is finished, it is again the responsibility of the \\noperating system to take the memory space back for re-\\nOperating system is called \\nresource manager as it \\nmanages different resources \\nlike main memory, CPU, \\nI/O devices, so that each \\nresource is used optimally \\nand system performance does \\nnot deteriorate.\\nCh 1.indd   22 08-Apr-19   11:36:17 AM\\n2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Chapter.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='Computer SyStem\\n23\\nutilisation. Hence, memory management concerns with \\nmanagement of main memory so that maximum memory \\nis occupied or utilised by large number of processes \\nwhile keeping track of each and every location within \\nthe memory as free or occupied. \\n(C) File Management \\nData and programs are stored \\nas files in the secondary \\nstorage of a computer system. File management involves \\nthe creation, updation, deletion and protection of these \\nfiles in the secondary memory. Protection is a crucial \\nfunction of an operating system, as multiple users can \\naccess and use a computer system. There must be a \\nmechanism in place that will stop users from accessing \\nfiles that belong to some other user and have not been \\nshared with them. File management system manages \\nsecondary memory, while memory management system \\nhandles the main memory of a computer system. \\n(D) Device Management \\nA computer system has many I/O devices and hardware \\nconnected to it. \\nOperating system manages these \\nheterogeneous devices that are interdependent. The \\noperating system interacts with the device driver and the \\nrelated software for a particular device. The operating \\nsystem must also provide the options for configuring \\na particular device, so that it may be used by an end \\nuser or some other device. Just like files, devices also \\nneed security measures and their access to different \\ndevices must be restricted by the operating system to \\nthe authorised users, software and other hardware only.\\nnoteS\\nSummary\\n• A computing device, also referred as computer, \\nprocesses the input data as per given instructions \\nto generate desired output. \\n• Computer system has four physical components \\nviz.\\n (i) CPU, (ii) Primary Memory, (iii) Input Device \\nand (iv) Output Devices.

      "memory   — primary and secondary. \n",
      "(A) Primary Memory\n",
      "Primary memory is an essential component of \n",
      "a \n",
      "computer system. Program and data are loaded into the \n",
      "primary memory before processing. The CPU interacts \n",
      "directly with the primary memory to perform read or \n",
      "write operation. It is of two types viz. (i) Random Access \n",
      "Memory (RAM) and (ii) Read Only Memory (ROM).\n",
      "RAM is volatile, i.e., as long as the power is supplied \n",
      "to the computer, it retains the data in it. But as soon \n",
      "as the power supply is turned off, all the contents of \n",
      "RAM are wiped out. It is used to store data temporarily \n",
      "while the computer is working. Whenever the computer \n",
      "is started or a software application is launched, the \n",
      "required program and data are loaded into RAM \n",
      "for processing. RAM is usually referred to as main \n",
      "memory and it is faster than the secondary memory or \n",
      "storage devices.\n",
      "On the other hand, ROM is non-volatile, which \n",
      "means its contents are not lost even when the power is \n",
      "turned off. It is used as a small but faster permanent \n",
      "storage for the contents which are rarely changed. For \n",
      "example, the startup program (boot loader) that loads \n",
      "the operating system into primary memory, is stored  \n",
      "in ROM.\n",
      "(B) Cache Memory\n",
      "RAM is faster than secondary storage, but not as \n",
      "fast \n",

      "size, clock speed, etc. These features are briefly \n",
      "explained below:\n",
      "(A) Word Size\n",
      "Word size is the maximum number of bits that a \n",
      "microprocessor can process at a time. Earlier, a word \n",
      "was of 8 \n",
      "bits, as it was the maximum limit at that \n",

      "maximum word size is 64 bits.\n",
      "(B) Memory Size\n",
      "Depending upon the word size, the size \n",
      "of RAM varies. \n",
      "Initially, RAM was very small (4MB) due to 4/8 bits word \n",
      "size. As word size increased to 64 bits, it has become \n",

      "Computers have an internal clock that generates \n",
      "pulses \n",
      "(signals) at regular intervals of time. Clock speed simply \n",

      "density, it is now measured in Gigahertz (GHz), i.e., \n",
      "billions of pulses per second.\n",

      "written in machine language is difficult. \n",
      "To simplify the writing of code, assembly language \n",
      "was developed that allowed usage of English-like words \n",
      "and symbols instead of 1s and 0s. But one major \n",
      "drawback of writing a code in this language is that the \n",
      "code is computer specific, i.e., the code written for one \n",
      "type of CPU cannot be used for another type of CPU.\n",
      "High level languages are machine independent and \n",

      "Now let us explore the important services and tasks \n",
      "that an operating system provides for managing the \n",
      "computer system.\n",
      "(A) Process Management\n",
      "While a computer system is operational, different tasks \n",
      "are running simultaneously. A program is \n",
      "intended to \n",
      "carry out various tasks. A task in execution is known \n",
      "as process. We can activate a system monitor program \n",
      "that provides information about the processes being \n",
      "executed on a computer. In some systems it can be \n",
      "activated using Ctrl+Alt+Delete. It is the responsibility \n",
      "of operating system to manage these processes and get \n",
      "multiple tasks completed in minimum time. As CPU is \n",
      "the main resource of computer system, its allocation \n",
      "among processes is the most important service of the \n",
      "operating system. Hence process management concerns \n",
      "the management of multiple processes, allocation \n",
      "of required resources, and exchange of information \n",
      "among processes.\n",
      "(B) Memory Management\n",
      "Primary or main memory of a computer system is \n",
      "usually limited. The main task of \n",
      "memory management \n",
      "is to give (allocate) and take (free) memory from running \n",
      "processes. Since there are multiple processes running \n",
      "at a time, there arises a need to dynamically (on-the-go) \n",
      "allocate and free memory to the processes. Operating \n",
      "system should do it without affecting other processes \n",
      "that are already residing in the memory and once the \n",
      "process is finished, it is again the responsibility of the \n",
      "operating system to take the memory space back for re-\n",
      "Operating system is called \n",
      "resource manager as it \n",
      "manages different resources \n",

      "the memory as free or occupied. \n",
      "(C) File Management \n",
      "Data and programs are stored \n",
      "as files in the secondary \n",
      "storage of a computer system. File management involves \n",
      "the creation, updation, deletion and protection of these \n",
      "files in the secondary memory. Protection is a crucial \n",
      "function of an operating system, as multiple users can \n",
      "access and use a computer system. There must be a \n",
      "mechanism in place that will stop users from accessing \n",

      "system must also provide the options for configuring \n",
      "a particular device, so that it may be used by an end \n",
